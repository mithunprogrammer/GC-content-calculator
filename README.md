# GC-content-calculator
GC percentage can be calculated using python script

Dependencies: Python2 or higher. Biopython

GC-content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C) in a DNA or RNA molecule. This measure indicates the proportion of G and C bases out of an implied four total bases, also including adenine and thymine in DNA and adenine and uracil in RNA. In DNA sequence, The total number Cytosine and Guanine bases in the sequence can be calculated by formula:

GC % = Total number of G's + Total number of C's / A+T+G+C * 100
